The project works as an image recognition classificator of banana, orange, and apple.

In this exercise we propose two solutions:
1- An assembly of two classifiers where the best answer was voted. The classifiers used were ExtraTree, RandomForest.
2- A convolutional network with transfer learning. (You Only Look Once)
We obtained better results with the convolutional network.
